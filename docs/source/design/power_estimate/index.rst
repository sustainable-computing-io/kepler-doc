Kepler Power Estimation
==============================

In Kepler, we also provide a power estimation solution from the resource usages in the system that there is no power measuring tool installed or supported. 
There are two alternatives of estimators.

- **Local Linear Regression Estimator**: This estimator estimates power using the trained weights multiplied by normalized value of usage metrics (Linear Regression Model).

- **General Estimator Sidecar**: This estimator transforms the usage metrics and applies with the trained models which can be any regression models from scikit-learn library or any neuron networks from Keras (TensorFlow). To use this estimator, the `Kepler General Estimator` component needs to be enabled.

On top of that, the trained models as well as weights can be updated periodically with online trainning routine by connecting the `Kepler Model Server` component.


Deployment Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Minimum Deployment**

The minimum deployment is to use local linear regression estimator in Kepler main container with only offline-trained model weights.

**Deployment with General Estimator Sidecar**

To enable general estimator for power inference, the estimator sidecar can be deployed as shown in the following figure. 
The connection between two containers is a unix domain socket which is lightweight and fast.
Unlike the local estimator, the general estimator sidecar is instrumented with several inference-supportive libraries and dependencies.
This additional overhead must be tradeoff to an increasing estimation accuracy expected from flexible choices of models.

  Deployment without Online Model Server

**Minimum deployment connecting to Kepler Model Server**

To get the updated weights which is expected to provide better estimation accuracy, Kepler may connect to remote Kepler Model Server that performs online trainning using data from the system with the power measuring tool as below.

**Full deployment**

The following figure shows the deployment that Kepler General Estimator is enabled and it is also connecting to remote Kepler Model Server. 
The Kepler General Estimator sidecar can update the model from the Kepler Model Server on the fly and expect the most accurate model.
