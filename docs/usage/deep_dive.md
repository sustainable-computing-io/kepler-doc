# Kepler Deep Dive

- [ ] Components and what they do
- [ ] What metrics are gathered on various systems
    * [ ] BM
    * [ ] VM
    * [ ] Linux standalone
- [ ] Why these metric?
- [ ] How is the power consumption attribution done?
- [ ] Explain the [models](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler-model-server/tree/main/tests/test_models). How the models are different and is there a right use case/scenario for when to apply a particular model over another?
    * [ ] AbsComponentModelWeight
    * [ ] AbsComponentPower
    * [ ] AbsModelWeight
    * [ ] AbsPower
    * [ ] DynComponentModelWeight
    * [ ] DynComponentPower
    * [ ] XGBoost

- [ ] Each model has three sub models BPFOnly, CgroupOnly, CounterOnly but we use only one of these models. Why is that?
